# alien-invasion-game
This game was created by following Python Crash Course of by Eric Matthes.
1. Instruction : 
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
2. Requirements:
Python 3.x
pygame 
In my opinion, this game is one easy-to-build game for those who are new to Python, the instruction in the book is really impressive, illustrative and easy to understand and practice.
3. Run:
python3 alien_invasion.py
